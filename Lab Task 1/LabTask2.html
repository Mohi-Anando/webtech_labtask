      <h2 class="h1">Lionel Messi</h2>
      <p class="p1">Biography</p>
      <p>
        Lionel Messi is a soccer player with Paris Saint-Germain and the
        Argentina national team. He has established records for goals scored and
        won individual awards en route to worldwide recognition as one of the
        best players in soccer.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h1">Who is Lionel Messi</h2>
      <p>
        Luis Lionel Andres (“Leo”) Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who
        plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national team.
        At the age of 13, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC Barcelona
        agreed to pay for his medical treatments. <br />
        There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history,
        helping his club win more than two dozen league titles and tournaments.
        In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and in 2019,
        he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the sixth time.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h1">Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy,
        Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their
        friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was
        recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based
        club. <br />Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group,
        Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone
        deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and
        Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for
        their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred
        dollars per month for the medication. <br />
        So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at
        soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have his
        medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved
        across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often
        homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior
        system ranks. <br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="h1">Soccer Career and Teams</h2>
      <p>
        Messi has only played for FC Barcelona, where he first signed at age 13.
        He also plays for the Argentina national team.
      </p>
      <img class="img1" src="Image/GHP_MESSI-BOOTS_16-9.jpg" alt="Messi2" />
      <p>
        By the age of 16, Messi made his first appearance for the FC Barcelona,
        putting himself in the record books on May 1, 2005, as the youngest
        player to ever score a goal for the franchise. That same year, he led
        Argentina to the title in the under-20 World Cup, scoring on a pair of
        penalty kicks to propel the team over Nigeria.<br />
        Amazingly, the soccer wizard continued to improve, discovering new ways
        to elude defenders while leading Barcelona to La Liga and Spanish Super
        Cup championships in 2010 and 2011, as well as the '11 Champions League
        title.<br />
        By the end of 2012, Messi had accumulated an astounding 91 goals in club
        and international play, eclipsing the 85 netted in a single calendar
        year by Gerd Muller in 1972. Fittingly, he broke another record when he
        was named the FIFA Ballon d'Or winner for the fourth time in January
        2013.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h1">Stats</h2>
      <p>
        As of August 2019, Messi's all-time highlights for FC Barcelona:<br />
        Messi has won FIFA's Player of the Year six times. He's also won the
        European Golden Shoe for top scorer six times, two more than his nearest
        rival, Cristiano Ronaldo. <br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="h1">Charity and Unicef</h2>

      <p>
        Although famously private off the field, Messi has quietly helped others
        in need. In 2007, he formed the Leo Messi Foundation to provide
        opportunities for disadvantaged youths. In early 2010, UNICEF named him
        a goodwill ambassador, with a focus on fighting for children's rights
        across the globe.
